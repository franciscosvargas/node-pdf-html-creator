# NodeJS HTML2PDF Generator

Hi! This project shows how to generate a pdf file from a HTML template file.

# Dependencies

To make this happen we need to use **Puppeteer** and **Handlebars**.

**Puppeteer** create a headless browser where we can navigate between pages and take screenshots or **SAVE A PDF FROM BROWSER PROGRAMATICALLY**.

**Handlebars** allow us to insert variables in HTML, such as PHP does, but, more cool.
